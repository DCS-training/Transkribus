# Transkribus
 Introductory Course on Transkribus and HTR

 This course will explain and demonstrate the **Handwritten Text Recognition** (HTR) platform *Transkribus*, a popular tool since its release for making historical documents more readable and accessible.
 
 These two sessions will ensure that you get to grips with the basics of transcribing handwritten documents using this software, and will teach you how to build your own HTR model, whilst avoiding the pitfalls in using automatic transcription.

**In the first session we will cover**

 -  the role of HTR and OCR technologies and how they differ as tools
 -  Uploading documents to Transkribus
 -  Identifying text zones and images
 -  Segmentation and baselines
 -  Working with distorted or broken text
 -  Abbreviations, contractions and unusual characters
 -  Transcribing written material manually  

**In the second session we will**

-   Train and run an HTR model
-   Discuss a suitable Character Error Rate (CER)
-   How to improve CER and the model
-   Keyword spotting tool
-   Other functions of Transkribus
